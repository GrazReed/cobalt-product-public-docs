Learn the meaning of the labels associated with your pentests.

From the moment you've started saving a draft of a pentest, we assign a label
for that pentest. We've set up these definitions as if you've set up the pentest
through our user interface. Here's the meaning of each label:

<!-- Review note, we pull description content from files in the layouts/shortcodes/ directory. For example, for the {{% draft-pentest-state %}} variable, we pull content from the `draft-pentest-state.html` file. -->

| Label       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Pentests remain in _Remediation_ until you've addressed all findings. You can address each finding by either:

- Remediating the finding.
- Accepting the finding, and any associated security risk.
