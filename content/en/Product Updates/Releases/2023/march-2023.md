## Shorter 7-Day Agile Pentests

<span style="color:#248BD2; font-weight:500; background-color: #DCECF8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 2px;">Pentests</span>

You can now complete Agile pentests of 3 or 4 credits in as little as **7 business days**.
With Agile pentests, you can test a smaller scope of your asset, such as a new release, a single vulnerability or microservice, a specific OWASP category, and more.

Launch flexible pentests aligned to your development lifecycles—and get results faster. Learn more about Cobalt pentests.
