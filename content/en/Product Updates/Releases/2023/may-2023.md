## Faster 7-Day Agile Pentests

{{% release-pentests %}}

You can now complete Agile pentests of 3 or 4 credits in as little as **7 business days**. With Agile pentests, you can **test a smaller scope of your asset**, such as a new release, a single vulnerability or microservice, a specific OWASP category, and more.

Launch flexible pentests aligned to your development lifecyclesâ€”and get results faster. Learn more about [Cobalt pentests](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-types/).

## New Combined Asset: Web + API + External Network

{{% release-assets %}}

We've added a new [asset type](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/) to our asset family: **Web + API + External Network**.

You no longer need to create 2 separate assets if your system combines 3 asset types. Once you've set up an asset, you can launch multiple pentests for it, without having to recreate the asset for each new pentest.

Set up combined assets, and launch [pentests](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-types/) with the appropriate methodology aligned to your pentest program.
