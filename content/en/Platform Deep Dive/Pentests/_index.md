Refer to the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) guide to set up a pentest in four stages:

1. Define your [assets](/getting-started/assets/).
1. Set pentest [requirements](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/).
1. Add pentest [details](/getting-started/details/).
1. [Plan and scope](/getting-started/planning/) the pentest.

Once the pentest is complete, you can download a [pentest report](./reports/) to explore security issues that our pentesters found.

## Duplicate an Existing Pentest

You can even duplicate existing pentests, as long as they're beyond the
[draft](/penteststates/) state. To do so:

1. Sign in to Cobalt
1. Select **Pentests** from the left-hand pane
1. Select the three-dot menu associated with the pentest
1. Select **Copy**

After you confirm your request, we'll create a [draft](/penteststates/) pentest
with your data. We'll then take you to our wizard with the existing asset, where
you can set pentest [requirements](../../getting-started/pentest-objectives/).
