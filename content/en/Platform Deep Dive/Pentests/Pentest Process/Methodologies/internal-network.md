We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page, based in large part on the
[OSSTMM](/getting-started/glossary#open-source-security-testing-methodology-manual-osstmm).

## Special Pentester Needs

We perform Our pentests of internal networks remotely. To support this access, our pentesters need:

- Access to your internal network through a stable VPN.
- A lightweight Linux server inside the network, used as a [jump box](/getting-started/glossary#jump-box).
  - If you use AWS for your internal network, you can use
    [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fznsw3f7mq7to) to set up a virtual machine.
  - You can also download a [Kali VM Image](https://www.kali.org/get-kali).
  - You'll need to set up [key-based SSH access](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh) for each pentester.

## Internal Networks

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OSSTMM standard for
penetration testing. Our team takes the following steps to ensure full coverage:

- Service Discovery
  - Port scans on specific IP ranges
  - Focus on public-facing services
  - Follow-up with further tests
- Vulnerability scans
  - Test for penetration of the internal network
- Manual assessment
  - Public-facing services (Web, FTP, email, firewalls, routers, DNS, VPNs, and more)
  - Access control systems such as Microsoft Active Directory
  - Less secure email protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
  - Printers
- Report, triage, and retest
