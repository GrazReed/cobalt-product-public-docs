We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OSSTMM standard for
penetration testing. Our team takes the following steps to ensure full coverage:

During manual assessment, our pentesters focus on specific identified resources associated with your external network.
In most cases, we focus on visibly open services related to:

- Web
- FTP
- Email (incoming and outgoing)
- Firewalls
- Routers
- DNS servers
- Other services that are in place on the external IP address range
  - Includes Office 365

While pentesters perform checks based on the specifics of a given situation, we share the following "typical" scenario:
