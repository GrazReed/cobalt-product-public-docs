Collaborate with pentesters, your teammates, and Cobalt Staff throughout a pentest.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

As our pentesters test your asset, they update you on their progress in real time. Here's what to expect:

- Pentesters report vulnerabilities that they discover in your software.
- You may get questions from our pentesters.
- You can submit comments to pentesters and your teammates.
- [Cobalt Staff](/getting-started/glossary/#cobalt-staff) members may get in touch to ask you for help.

## Collaboration Platforms

When you set up a pentest, you can [select](/getting-started/planning/#select-a-collaboration-platform) where you want to collaborate with Cobalt Staff and pentesters:

- [Cobalt Chat](#collaborate-in-cobalt-chat):
  - You can send messages through the Cobalt platform.
  - You don't have access to the Slack channel dedicated for your pentest.
- [Slack](#use-slack-for-communication):
  - We invite you to the Slack channel dedicated for your pentest.
  - You have read-only access to Cobalt Chat, but you can't send messages.

You can change your preference until the pentest is Planned.

You can also read real-time [updates from pentesters](#read-updates-from-pentesters) in the Cobalt app, regardless of where you collaborate on the pentest.

### Collaborate in Cobalt Chat

If you selected **Cobalt Chat** as your collaboration platform, you can communicate with pentesters and [pentest collaborators](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/user-roles/) in the Cobalt app, without using third-party tools. You don't have access to the pentest Slack channel.

On the pentest page, select the chat icon ![Chat icon](/icons/Chat.png "Chat icon"), and then select **Chat** in the sidebar that opens.

![Collaborate on a pentest in the Messages sidebar](/deepdive/OpenMessagesSidebar.png "Collaborate on a pentest in the Messages sidebar")

Use the chat to communicate with pentesters, pentest collaborators, and [Cobalt Staff](/getting-started/glossary/#cobalt-staff) in real time.

- To send a message, enter it in the input field, and then select **Comment**.
- To mention a user in your message, type @, and select a user. Users get email notifications for each mention.
- You can add emoji to your messages.
- You can edit or delete your comments once posted.

As our pentesters share vulnerabilities that they find in real time, you can start [remediating findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/) before the pentest is complete. Review and analyze each [finding](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/). You can:

### Use Slack for Communication

If you selected **Slack** as your collaboration platform, you can communicate with pentesters and your teammates in a Slack channel dedicated for your pentest. You also have read-only access to [Cobalt Chat](#collaborate-in-cobalt-chat), but you can't send messages.

To learn more about Slack channels, read the [Slack documentation](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360017938993-What-is-a-channel).

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
The Slack channel is available until your pentest is [Closed](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/).
{{< /alert >}}

The image below illustrates how to use Slack throughout a pentest.

1. Once we move your pentest to [In Review](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/), we create a dedicated Slack channel. On the pentest page, select the Slack icon ![Slack icon](/icons/Slack.png "Slack icon"), and then select **Open Slack Channel #**.
    - If you don't have access to the Slack channel, contact {{% csm-support %}}.
    - If you're new to Slack, read the [Slack documentation](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/categories/360000049043) for help.<br><br>
   ![Open a Slack channel from the pentest page](/deepdive/SlackChannelOpen.png "Open a Slack channel from the pentest page")
1. Add the colleagues of your choice to the Slack channel. Choose colleagues who can benefit from direct communication with our pentesters. To learn more about adding users to Slack, read the [Slack documentation](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/201980108-Add-people-to-a-channel).
1. Once we've moved your pentest to [Planned](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/), you'll see your pentesters in the Slack channel.
1. When the pentest goes [Live](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/), our pentesters share vulnerabilities that they find in real time. Start [remediating findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/) before the pentest is complete.<br>Here's an example message from a pentester in Slack.<br><br>
    ![Collaborate on a pentest in Slack](/deepdive/SampleSlackFinding.png "Collaborate on a pentest in Slack")
1. Review and analyze each [finding](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/). You can:
    {{% process-findings %}}
1. We keep the Slack channel open until you resolve all findings, which includes {{% resolved-finding-states %}}
1. We archive the Slack channel once we move the pentest to [Closed](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/).
    - If you need access to the archived channel, contact {{% csm-support %}}.

## Read Updates from Pentesters

You can read updates from our pentesters as they test your [asset](/platform-deep-dive/assets/), regardless of where you collaborate on the pentest.

On the pentest page, select the chat icon ![Chat icon](/icons/Chat.png "Chat icon"). You can view messages from pentesters in the sidebar that opens, on the **Pentester Updates** tab.
