We support additional [asset types](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/) for Specialized Pentests conducted by our Professional Services team, such as IOT, Thick Client, and more. You can't create a Specialized Pentest or set up a special asset in the UIâ€”we'll do that for you. Once the Specialized Pentest is set up, you can:
- Edit the asset details, including [description](/getting-started/assets/asset-description/)
- Edit pentest parameters
