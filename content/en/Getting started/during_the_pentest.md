You've reviewed the [Pentest Checklist](../checklist/). You've submitted the pentest
for review. Here's what you should do next:

<!-- see layouts/shortcodes/pentest-in-review.html for content -->
{{% pentest-in-review %}}

   {{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
   Be ready to respond to **Critical** findings, especially if they pose a significant risk.

   Do not update your asset for other findings until the pentest is complete, as
   that risks compromising our pentest work in progress.
   {{% /alert %}}

Tell your team about the pentest. In rare cases, a pentest might disrupt service to an asset.

Now you can read about [Pentest Expectations](../what-to-expect/).
