## Cobalt Core Contributors

Cobalt is setting up a program where [Cobalt Core](https://cobalt.io/our-pentesters) pentesters
write articles that we'll organize into a **Best Practices for Security** guide.

We're focusing this program on the [OWASP 2021 Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/). For now,
we're limiting this program to pentesters who are already members of the Cobalt Core 
community.

Selected pentester authors will:

- Follow Cobalt styles as described in our [Grammar Linter](#GrammarLinter)
- Write to maximize readability for an audience of developers.

Our ideal candidate has: 

- The ability to write digestible and authentic content
  - A willingness to modify content for Cobalt writing styles
- In-depth knowledge of security issues related to the OWASP 2021 Top 10
  - Initially, weâ€™ll focus on the top three OWASP categories
- The ability to write in Markdown (Goldmark)
- Basic knowledge of Git
  - The ability to submit and manage a pull request (PR)
