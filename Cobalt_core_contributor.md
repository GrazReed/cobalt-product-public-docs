## Cobalt Core Contributors

Cobalt is setting up a program where [Cobalt Core](https://cobalt.io/our-pentesters) pentesters
write articles that we'll organize into a **Best Practices for Security** guide.

We're focusing this program on the [OWASP 2021 Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/). For now,
we're limiting this program to pentesters who are already members of the Cobalt Core 
community.

Selected pentester authors will:

- Follow Cobalt styles as described in our [Grammar Linter](#GrammarLinter)
- Write to maximize readability for an audience of developers.
