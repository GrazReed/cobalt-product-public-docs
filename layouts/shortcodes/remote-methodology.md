### Remote Sites and Virtual Private Networks

You may have set up a corporate network to connect to other offices over a VPN. While VPNs support secure communication, they may be vulnerable
to the same configuration problems as firewalls, because firewalls handle the VPN. If someone 
makes a mistake when they configure your VPN, that can lead to an attack vector to a
corporate network.
