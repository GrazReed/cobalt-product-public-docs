During this testing phase, pentesters review collected reports to determine risks across the environment. This includes:

- Gathering and analyzing all the reports from different tools in detail
- Comparing data with potential areas of focus that the customer defined

Then, pentesters do the following:

- Retest or confirm any detected anomalies or misconfigurations
- Perform risk assessment exercises based on the [CIS Critical Security Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls) best practices
- Assign severity levels to findings based on their impact and likelihood
