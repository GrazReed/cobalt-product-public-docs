### Web Servers

Web servers are vulnerable to defacement attacks, or could be used as a launching pad for further attacks against internal networks.
Our pentesters scan all web servers (client side) for potential exploits and vulnerabilities that could leave the door open for a potential
attacker, such as:

- Poor patching policy
- Default installation
