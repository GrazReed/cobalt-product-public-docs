During the initial phase of testing, pentesters do the following:

- Examine the provided documentation and confirmed scope
- Using various [tools](#tools), test the presence of different components and technologies within the cloud-based environment
- Perform external scope discovery exercises to determine the following:
  - Discoverable attack surface
  - Externally exposed landscape

Initial examination and discovery helps pentesters ensure that they:

- Have the required level of access to your system
- Can fully access the scope
- Can access externally exposed components

After the initial examination, pentesters develop an assessment execution plan to follow throughout the rest of the engagement.
