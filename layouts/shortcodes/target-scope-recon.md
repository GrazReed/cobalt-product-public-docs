Our pentesters search for all information that a malicious user might find. For example, to
connect to the internet, you typically have shared some information. For example:

- To receive email, you need to post a mail server address
- To set up a web server, you need to post its URL and more

Our pentesters know how attackers can gain access to internal resources. These methods include:

- Brute-forcing credentials using discovered company email formats
- Building password dictionaries which contain public business information from the corporate website. 

Our pentesters may go further in the following areas:

### Your Corporate Website

Our pentesters evaluate your website in ways that could interest a potential attacker, including:

- Locations (URLs)
- Domain information
- Contact details (such as phone numbers, email, and physical addresses)
- Links to other servers within an organization
- Other companies with links to your website
- Information on the security policy of your organization 

### Other Web Locations and Databases

Our pentesters search for information on your asset from other websites and databases. They
focus on information from publicly traded companies. They'll evaluate the public information
that they find, including the information that goes beyond what's required by local laws.

They also evaluate news articles and press releases for more clues about your security policy.

### Your Domain Names

Our pentesters use "whois" databases to identify the domains that you own. These domains
can provide information about your network infrastructure. Some databases include information
about your network.

### Public Records

Public records, such as those available on "whois" databases, may include the:

- Name
- Address
- Telephone number

Attackers may use social engineering to get extra information. They may look for details such as purchases
of hardware and software. Such information can help attackers target your system.

### Tools

Our pentesters use tools such as:

- Nmap
- dirbuster
- Shodan
- Censys.io

With these tools, they can find:

- IP addresses
- Attached networks
- Open ports
- Webcams
- Printers
- Other devices connected to your network

With this information, our pentesters can identify potential weaknesses, including:

- Accidental leaks of sensitive information
- Open network ports
- Unsecured network devices
- Unpatched software
- Leaked or exposed assets on [pastebins](https://pastebin.com/)
