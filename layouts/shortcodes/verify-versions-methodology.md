### Verifying Use of Secure Versions

As researchers discover vulnerabilities and security flaws in software, software vendors release patches for their products. Our pentesters
search for outdated and unpatched versions of software. They run tests against published and patched exploits.

Older versions have lower security thresholds and leave data vulnerable. According to the [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/),
some of the most common vulnerabilities are based on outdated versions of Office 365. Cobalt can help you with that.
