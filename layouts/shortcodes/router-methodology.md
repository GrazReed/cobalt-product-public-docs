### Routers

All connections between networks and the Internet typically go through a border router managed by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
We locate all visible routers, establish the manufacturer and operating system (OS), then check for potential vulnerabilities. Our tests include:

- Checking software, to make sure your routers are patched and up to date
- Default user accounts such as `admin`
- Attempts to access the router using databases of well-known default passwords and settings
