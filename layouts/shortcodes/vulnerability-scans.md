Our pentesters identify vulnerabilities in the external-facing portion of the
network. They try to penetrate external endpoints, to see how others may access your 
internal network and resources. 

If a potential attacker achieves this goal, an organization could face: 

- Leaks of sensitive or confidential information being leaked from the organization's network. Such leaks could include:
  - Personnel records
  - Payment data
  - Other financial records
<br>
- Attackers who use the mail gateway or website as the source of spam:
  - This could lead to others who blacklist the domain of the organization
  - Others could reject legitimate emails from the organization
<br>
- Defacing of the website. Attackers may even substitute their own version of the website where current or potential customers sign in.
  - The organization could lose credibility or even potential customers
<br>
- Service disruptions. Such attacks could disrupt or disable services.
