### Domain Name System (DNS)

Network users need the ability to query DNS servers. If you have your own DNS server, a failure could affect your internet connection.
If an attacker gets access to your DNS server, they could find out how:

- The domain sends and receives email
- Servers that support your website

One serious DNS configuration error would allow unknown internet users to perform a DNS zone transfer, which could allow attackers to access
more valuable information about your network.
