### Firewalls

A firewall is designed to be the main gateway to an organization, with rules to protect internal resources. They are not an
"out-of-the-box" solution. Our pentesters look for:

- Firewalls that are configured for the specific needs of your business
- Firewall software that's up to date with patches and maintenance
- Configuration errors that could leave a path into the corporate LAN

Our pentesters test your firewall rules based on attacks, such as:

- Buffer overflows
- IP spoofing
- Corrupted IP packets
- Attacks against open services
