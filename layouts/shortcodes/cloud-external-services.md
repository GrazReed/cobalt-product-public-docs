Based on the scope, pentesters perform an external manual and automated assessment over all externally exposed systems and services. During this phase, the goal is to:

- Perform a basic vulnerability assessment
- Discover any service-related vulnerabilities that were not detected during internal configuration scans

Pentesters identify configuration-related findings that have an external impact and verify them through the public interfaces using the endpoints that they gathered internally.
