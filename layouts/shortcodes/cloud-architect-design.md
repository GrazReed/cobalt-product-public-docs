During this stage of the assessment, pentesters manually review the cloud configuration architecture provided by the customer. Pentesters do the following:

- Review and assess the current overall layout of the architecture from the risks perspective
- Search for security-related issues

The design of the cloud infrastructure is critical to ensure the overall security posture of your environment. To assess the risks realistically, our pentesters:

- Follow industry best practices
- Combine their findings data with component configuration reports

To ensure better coverage, upon request, pentesters can gather additional information about your internal procedures, such as:

- Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
- Patching
- Access management

Having extensive information, pentesters can fully assess the system and advise on the overall security posture.
