Welcome to the contributions guide for Cobalt Product Documentation

Thank you for contributing to our project! We'll build your contributions at
developer.cobalt.io.

## Branch names

If you're a Cobalt employee, please include the name of the Jira ticket in the name of the
branch. For example, if you're making changes for a ticket named DOCS-12345, specify a
branch name like:

```
DOCS-12345_reason_for_change
```

Alternatively, if you do not have a Jira ticket, specify a branch name like 

```
NO-TICKET_reason_for_change
```

If you're a Cobalt employee, include the group name acronym with the ticket, such as:

```
EX-NO-TICKET_reason_for_change
```

We'll include a Continuous Integration job which reviews branch names.
